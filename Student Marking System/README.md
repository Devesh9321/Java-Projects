# Student Hostel Management System

## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project we made simple Hostel Management System. This 
is use to manage the data of student and Employee in hostelâ€™s like how 
many student are live in our hostel, how many employee do work in our 
hostel and store information of all student in single software or 
application. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The java AWT package provides classes for AWT API such as 
TextField, Label, TextArea, RadioButton, CheckBox, Choice, List etc. 
The reason for this is the platforms have different view for their native 
components and AWT directly calls the native subroutine that creates 
those components.
